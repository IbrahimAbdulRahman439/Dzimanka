                            charging, 'vampire' electronics can still suck up energy. Saving electricity means less

                            Reuse bottles, bags, and containers whenever you can. And for what's left, learn what can be
                            recycled in your area of Ghana – plastics, paper, glass, and metal. Less waste means less

                            Take shorter showers, and if you spot a leaky faucet, tell an adult to fix it. Every drop

                            leftovers properly. Choose local and seasonal produce when you can – it means less energy
                            used for transport and storage. Also, if you can, learn about composting food scraps to turn

                <p>Ever wonder who's actually out there making a difference? Meet the Buz Stop Boys, a crew of young
                    Ghanaians led by Heneba Kwadwo Sarfo who decided to stop complaining and start cleaning! Back in July
                    2023, Heneba and just four friends grabbed some tools and hit the streets of Accra. Their mission? To
                    clear out those messy, choked-up gutters and trash piles that everyone walks past. It was tough, dirty
                    work, but they kept at it. What made them go viral? They filmed everything! Their "before & after"
                    videos on TikTok and Instagram blew up. People couldn't believe the transformations they were making,
                    turning filthy spots into clean spaces. Fast forward, and the Buz Stop Boys are now a massive team of
                    over 40 young volunteers. They're not just cleaning; they're inspiring everyone to care more about our
                    environment. They show that with passion and a phone, you can literally clean up your community and
                    spark a huge movement. They're proof that Ghana's youth are truly shaping a greener future!</p>

                            <p>Recycling services are growing in Ghana, especially in bigger cities. Check with your
                                local assembly or community groups for designated drop-off points or collection
                                services. Even if not fully available, reducing and reusing are always great options!

                            <p>Start by sharing what you've learned in a calm, positive way. Explain why it matters to
                                Ghana. Lead by example with your own actions, and invite them to join you in simple
                                green habits. Sometimes, seeing is believing!</p>

                            <p>It's okay to feel that way! Climate change is a big topic. Focus on one small action at a
                                time. Connect with friends or join a group – doing things together makes it much easier
                                and more fun. Remember, you're not alone in this journey!</p>
