        <h1>Understanding Climate Change</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="your-grid">
        <div class="your-card asa ass">
            <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>Think about the usual hot and rainy seasons we have in Ghana.
                Climate change is when these normal weather patterns start to change a lot over many years, making things hotter and less
                predictable, like Earth having a long-term fever. This big change is mostly because of things humans do, like burning fuel in cars and cutting down trees, which release gases that trap extra heat from
                the sun and warm our planet. This warming makes Ghana's weather act differently, affecting our farms with less reliable rain and hotter temperatures. It also harms our forests, which we need to be healthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="your-card asa ass">
            <h2>The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
            <p>Think of the sun warming Ghana. Some of that heat bounces back up. Our Earth has a special gas blanket, the atmosphere, that traps some of this warmth to keep us cozy – that's the natural greenhouse effect, and it's important for life. But when we burn fuel and cut down trees, we add more of these gases, making the blanket thicker. This thicker blanket traps even more of the sun's heat, like wearing too many clothes on a hot Accra day. This extra trapped heat makes the Earth warmer than it should be, and that's a big part of what's causing climate change.</p>

        <h1>What Causes Climate Change?</h1>
        <p>Climate change is happening because of certain gases trapping heat in our atmosphere. Let's explore where these come from:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="your-grid ">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="iii"><img src="img/low-angle-shot-factory-with-smoke-steam-coming-out-chimneys-captured-sunset-min-min.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="your-card asa">
            <h2>Burning Fossil Fuels</h2>
                <p>When we use petrol in cars and generate electricity from fuels like coal, it's like burning something. This burning releases invisible gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the air. These gases act like an extra blanket around the Earth, trapping more heat and making it warmer.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="iii"><img src="img/fo-min.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="your-card asa">
            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
                <p>Ghana's forests have lots of trees, and these trees do a very important job: they suck up a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. When we cut down many forests for things like farms and wood, there are fewer trees to clean the air, so more of that warming gas stays in the atmosphere.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="iii"><img src="img/_l3a0606 (1).jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="your-card asa">
                <h2>Industrial Processes & Waste</h2>
                <p>Factories making clothes, phones, or anything else we use, often release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. Even how we handle our trash plays a part! When food scraps and other organic waste pile up in huge landfills (where trash goes), they break down and release methane – another super-powerful 'blanket gas.' So, what we make and how we throw things away both add to the problem.</p>

        <h1>Effects of Climate Change</h1>
        <p>Globally, climate change is leading to rising temperatures, changing rainfall, sea-level rise, and more extreme
            weather. In Ghana, we are particularly vulnerable to:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="your-grid ">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="iii"><img src="img/Rainfall-1-min.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="your-card asa">
            <h2>Unpredictable Weather</h2>
                <p>Remember how our seasons used to be? Well, climate change is messing with them! We're seeing crazy unpredictable rains – sometimes it's way too much, causing sudden floods in our cities and towns (like in parts of Accra). Other times, there's not enough rain for super long periods, leading to droughts. This is a huge problem for our farmers who grow our favorite foods like cocoa and maize, making it harder for them to feed our nation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="iii"><img src="img/pexels-pixabay-301599-min.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="your-card asa">
            <h2>Increased Temperatures</h2>
                <p>Ghana is getting hotter because of climate change. Just like we feel tired and uncomfortable in extreme heat, our important crops like maize, cassava, and cocoa also get stressed. This heat makes them grow less and produce smaller harvests, meaning less food for our communities and impacting the livelihoods of farmers.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="iii"><img src="img/fort-batenstein-butri-beach-ghana-5-lesser-known-slave-forts-day-trip-from-takoradi-IMG_1465-1-1024x683-min.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
            <div class="your-card asa">
                <h2>Shrinking Coastlines</h2>
                <p>Our beautiful beaches along the Ghanaian coast? They're literally disappearing! With rising sea levels and stronger, wilder waves, the ocean is creeping further inland. This causes coastal erosion, washing away beaches, damaging roads, and even forcing people to leave their homes in places like Keta and Jamestown. It's like the ocean is trying to take back the land!</p>
            </div></div>
            
            <div class="card ma">

                <div class="your-card asa">
                    <h2>Water Stress & Health</h2>
                    <p>Less predictable rain means less reliable access to clean water in some areas. When water sources like rivers and wells dry up, it can make life really tough. Plus, warmer temperatures and different rain patterns can lead to more waterborne diseases (like cholera) or make other illnesses spread more easily. And on super hot days, heat stress can be a real health risk, especially for those working outdoors.</p>
                </div></div>

                    <div class="your-card asa">
                        <h2>Biodiversity Loss</h2>
                        <p>Ghana is home to incredible animals and plants – from monkeys in our forests to fish in our waters. But climate change is making it harder for some of these species to survive. As temperatures change and habitats are affected by things like floods or droughts, some plants and animals struggle to adapt, putting them at risk. We could lose some of our unique natural treasures!</p>
                    </div></div>
                    <div class="card ma">
                        <div class="iii"><img src="img/1-min.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
                        <div class="your-card asa">
                            <h2>Livelihoods & Economy Hit</h2>
                            <p>When climate change impacts our farms, fishing, and natural attractions, it directly affects how people earn a living in Ghana. Things like damaged crops, fewer fish in the sea, or coastal erosion hurting tourism can mean less money for families and communities. It's a big deal for our country's economy and everyone's well-being!</p>

            <h1>Ghana's Solutions & Actions</h1>
            <p>And guess what? Ghana is totally in on the action! We've got our own awesome solutions happening right here at home:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="your-grid">
            <div class="your-card saa">
                <div><img src="img/images.jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></div>
                <h2>Renewable Energy Growth</h2>
                <p>Ghana is tapping into its own clean power! Think about solar power projects popping up – using Ghana's abundant sunshine to generate electricity. We also have huge hydro-electric dams like Akosombo, which use water power. The more we use these, the less we rely on burning stuff that pollutes our air.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="your-card saa">
                <div><img src="img/Tree-Planting (1).jpeg" alt="" width="100%"></div><h2>Smart Farming & Reforestation</h2>
                <p>Our farmers are getting super clever! They're learning 'climate-smart' farming techniques that help crops survive weird weather, use less water, and keep the soil healthy. Plus, there are huge efforts like tree planting drives and protecting our existing forests. Remember, trees are CO2 heroes, so planting more and keeping them safe is a massive win for Ghana's climate!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="your-card saa">
                <div><img src="img/waste (1).jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div><h2>Waste to Wealth</h2>
                <p>Our trash can actually be treasure! In Ghana, people are getting serious about community recycling – turning plastic bottles into new products and organic waste into compost for farms. There are even ideas about turning waste into energy! It's all about making sure less garbage ends up in landfills, which reduces harmful gases and creates new opportunities.</p>
            </div>

                <div><img src="img/3K0A8581-scaled.original.png" alt="" width="100%"></div><h2>Youth-Led Initiatives</h2>
                <p>This is where YOU come in! Young people across Ghana are leading the way. Imagine starting a school recycling club, organizing beach clean-ups, launching awareness campaigns on social media, or even creating small community gardens. Every single action, big or small, adds up and inspires others to join the green movement!</p>

                <div><img src="img/independence-square-2419577_1280.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div><h2>Policy & Planning</h2>
                <p>Our country's leaders are also working on this! Ghana is putting together plans and policies to adapt to climate change (like building stronger coastal defenses) and reduce our emissions. It's about making big decisions and setting rules that help protect our nation for the future.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="your-card vaa">
                <div><img src="img/pexels-emmanuel-ikwuegbu-9628111-scaled (1).jpg" alt="" width="100%"></div><h2>Education & Awareness</h2>
                <p>One of the biggest powers we have is spreading the word! Learning about climate change (just like you're doing now!) and then sharing that knowledge with your friends, family, and community helps everyone understand the challenge and the solutions. The more people know, the more people act. So, keep learning and keep talking!</p>
